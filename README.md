# Full-Project-dashboard-for-Airbnb

Description
This project aims to optimize the average price of Airbnb listings for houses with different numbers of bedrooms in specific zip codes. The Tableau dashboard analyzes the prices of listings in different zip codes, the distinct count of listings by number of bedrooms, and the revenue generated by these listings for a particular year

The dashboard includes a range of visualizations, such as bar charts, heat maps, and line graphs, that display information such as the average price per zip code, the count of listings by number of bedrooms, and the revenue generated by these listings for the year. The dashboard also includes a dropdown menu that allows users to select different zip codes and see the corresponding average prices and number of listings for each number of bedrooms.
